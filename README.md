Greenhouse Sensors
======
**Greenhouse Sensors* is a script for getting my sensors to send data via WiFi to a Firebase db.
I owned a small farm in the Finger Lakes of New York. I wanted to see if my $100 Amazon greenhouse would provide adequate overnight temperature insulation for my seedlings. 
Results: no :)
